Since Ask does not have the option of specifying i.e n=30 and only has page=num feature, for a few of the quarries I could not get 10 results. Hence, as the professor mentioned in the assignment, I have used just the retrieved results to compare against Google.  Based on the observed stats, Ask performed poorly vs Google because the average number of overlapping results and average percent overlap were 0.7 and 7.0% (in-order) and really low - the percentage results show the low quality of Ask search engine vs our baseline (Google). The calculated average Spearman coefficient is -5.08 and a negative number show the Ask & Google rankings are dissimilar to each other.   By looking at individual query results, we notice in many cases Ask and Google do not have any similar ranking; hence the values are zero.  Lastly, due to continuous improvements from search engineers the results getting today might not be the same in the future (not a major change, + - 0.5 or more change in avg values).
